# First connection with Mixy

To connect with Mixy you need a device with BLE-capable Bluetooth adapter.

## Mixy Tester

With Mixy and Bluetooth enabled, first go to a [Mixy Tester page](https://mixylabs.github.io/tester).  
You need a Chromium-based browser for it to work, it can even be Chrome on Android.

There you can connect with Mixy and view its specs.
If knobs are not yet displayed, turn one of them for all to appear.

On the bottom of the page you can play with Mixy's parameters. They allow balancing responsivness and power efficiency.
To learn more, check out the [customization guide](../customization/hardware.md).


## Installing software

To make any use of Mixy you need some software that can communicate with it.

Go to [software selection](software_selection.md) to choose a dedicated program.

You can also use Mixy as a MIDI controller for any DAW or other music software.
Some of them will connect via Bluetooth by themselves, others will need MIDI-BLE to MIDI bridge.
