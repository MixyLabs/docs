# What everyone is asking about

## General


???+ question "Why are you doing this?"

    Me and my friends just find it useful.
    Also it's pretty cool and reasonably sized portfolio project.


???+ question "Is it open source?"

    Source code of every program developed for Mixy is or eventually will be free and open source.
    Licenses may change anytime.
    
    However the hardware, so any CAD/EDA designs, is and will be closed.


???+ question "Are you really selling it?"

    Somehow, sometimes, kinda.
