The higher the frequency, the better response time, but higher battery usage.</p> <p>They work like that:</p> <ul> <li>start with slow mode (sampling frequency controlled by <code>Slow Interval</code>)</li> <li>if knob change is detected, switch to fast mode</li> <li>sampling frequency controlled by <code>Fast Interval</code></li> <li>if no changes detected for <code>Fast Timeout</code>, switch back to slow mode</li> </ul> <p><code>Change Threshold</code> parameter controls knob movement sensitivity, usually there is no reason to change it.</p> <p>Based on above, you should understand that to save battery:</p> <ol> <li><code>Slow Interval</code> needs to be high</li> <li><code>Fast Interval</code> also needs to be high</li> <li>while <code>Fast Timeout</code> needs to be low</li> </ol> <p>In the future, some kind of calculator/formula will be provided.
